# evolve verb

`/flow evolve <sub-verb>`. Maintainer-only. Routed from SKILL.md's argument table. `evolve` is a **namespace**: the self-evolution loop's producers + consumers, one sub-verb each.

- **`/flow evolve audit`** — the cold-audit **producer** (§audit): scan flow's OWN codebase for evidence-backed improvements and file them as `audit` beads in flow's backlog. Read-then-file; it does not implement.
- **`/flow evolve propose`** — the multi-angle **proposal producer** (§propose): fan out one agent per generative angle (feature gaps, simplification, reorg, dead-weight, architecture, symmetry), adversarially verify, and file a ranked set. Provably-safe findings become auto-drainable `audit` beads; judgment findings become plain `proposal` beads (non-`evolve`) in the maintainer's own backlog, run via `/flow <key>`. Read-then-file; it does not implement.
- **`/flow evolve epic`** — the **high-altitude producer** (§epic): fan out web-reaching lenses for theme-scale work (capability tracks, architecture-era shifts, the meta-loop, unfinished tracks), gate on *conviction* not track-record (engage if grounded by a web cite / witness / bounded spike; refute only change-for-change's-sake), then file a parent `epic` bead + a tree of `proposal` children (the gearing into the per-ticket consumer). Maintainer-lane, weekly. Read-then-file; it does not implement.
- **`/flow evolve drain`** — the **consumer** (§drain): a single looping pass that drains the whole backlog. Each turn it reaps finished orphans (merge the green leaf PRs of runs that died before self-merging + teardown merged-and-exited worktrees, lease-gated), then fans out the next launchable batch as background `/flow <key> --auto` runs (each run self-merges its own green PR via the `merge` stage, post-Layer-2). It loops — launching, waiting while runs are live, reaping — until nothing is startable, draining hot beads sequentially. This is the nightly loop's consumer.

The sub-verbs here are **Producer B** (cold-audit + generative — `audit` mines defect-grain fixes, `propose` mines single-PR judgment work, `epic` mines theme-scale tracks); **Producer A** is the reflect sling (`references/stage-reflect.md`): lived friction during real runs. For the producer-A-vs-B framing and the auto-vs-propose backlog split (which findings auto-drain vs land in the maintainer's own backlog), see self-evolution.md §Producers.

## 0. Dispatch

Match the **second whitespace token** of the args against the sub-verb set by exact string equality:

- `audit` → §audit. `propose` → §propose. `epic` → §epic. `drain` → §drain.
- **empty** (bare `/flow evolve`, no sub-verb) → print the sub-verb listing above and stop. Do NOT default to a sub-verb; the namespace is explicit.
- **anything else** (unknown sub-verb) → print the listing + "unknown evolve sub-verb: `<token>`" and stop.

**`--dry-run`** is a modifier on `drain`: run ONE turn's reap + select classification and print the plan (what it would reap + launch), act on nothing. It is ignored on the read-only producers (`audit` / `propose` already change no live state).

**`--include-proposals`** is a DANGEROUS modifier on `drain`: it widens the loop to auto-drain plain `proposal` beads too, bypassing the human spec-plan accept gate (§`--include-proposals` below). Off by default; also ignored on the producers.

Every sub-verb runs the **Gate** below first.

## Gate — maintainer only

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/maintainer.py --workspace-root .
```

- Exit 0 → prints the flow repo root; you are the maintainer, continue with the dispatched sub-verb. Run against that repo.
- Exit 1 → not a maintainer setup (no `[maintainer]` marker). Print: "`/flow evolve` is maintainer-only; this workspace is not the flow self-improvement target." Stop. Do NOT audit or drain a user's project.

## audit

The cold-audit producer. Mine flow's own codebase for evidence-backed improvements and file them as `audit` beads.

### 1. Fan out evidence miners (read-only)

Spawn parallel read-only audit agents (`subagent_type: Explore` via the `Agent` tool — its read-only tool scope enforces the audit's read-only contract: no Edit/Write, no recursive `Agent` spawn — or a `Workflow` fan-out when available), one per evidence source. Every finding MUST cite concrete evidence — a `file:line` or a reproduced command — or it is not a candidate. No "could be cleaner". Mine, at least:

- **quality gates** — run `mise run lint`, `mise run test`, `python3 seam_check.py` from `scripts/`; every real failure / warning / lint-suppression is a finding.
- **test gaps** — public functions / branches with no test (use `MODULE.md` to map script → test). A claimed-missing test MUST be positively confirmed absent against the LIVE suite before it becomes a finding — a single grep-pattern miss can claim an already-tested path (flow-aod: both "missing" dispatch tests existed at the very test-count the evidence cited). Two independent probes, both required: (1) content-grep the whole `tests/` dir for the symbol AND its branch markers (function name, exit code, error string — a test may exercise the branch under a different name); (2) collect the live suite and grep node ids — from `scripts/`, run `mise exec python -- pytest tests/ --collect-only -q` once bare to confirm it reports N>0 tests collected, then piped `| grep -i <term>`. Grep finding nothing (empty output, exit 1) IS the clean-empty result; VOID means pytest itself errored or collected 0 — a VOID probe confirms nothing. Only both probes clean-and-empty support the claim, and the finding's evidence MUST stamp the exact probe commands + their empty results, so the plan stage can falsify the premise cheaply.
- **dead code & complexity** — unused defs (prove zero refs), very long / tangled functions.
- **doc drift** — `MODULE.md` / `inventory.md` / `SKILL.md` / `references/*.md` claims vs the actual code. For a PR-introduced *vocabulary/phrasing* drift (a renamed term, a reworded invariant, a changed concept name), the stale phrasing typically lives in EVERY reference describing that subsystem, not just the file the diff surfaced: grep the whole `references/*.md` + `SKILL.md` doc set for the old phrasing and enumerate ALL loci (every `file:line`) in the finding's description/evidence, so the one bead that fixes it names every locus — and when that bead is later spec'd its "Files to change" (and thus the stamped `planned_files`) covers them together. The finding's dedup identity still anchors on its single primary file (per §2); the multi-locus list belongs in the evidence, not the key.
- **friction & history** — unaddressed `MACHINERY:` entries in `knowledge.jsonl`, `TODO`/`FIXME`, recent git-log pain.
- **robustness** — real gaps in the load-bearing machinery (run lease, snapshot TOCTOU, atomic writes, ownership gate, flock). Tighten, never erode.
- **architecture / seam** — SKILL.md thinness, registry↔reference-doc consistency, prose↔CLI seam risks.

### 2. Synthesize, rank, assign stable ids

Dedup the raw findings (merge ones about the same root issue), drop the vague / unevidenced. Rank by evidence strength × value × blast-radius-safety × reviewability, then score each survivor against the repo-root `VISION.md` (serves the thesis / on the right side of the auto-vs-propose line / does not erode the floor — a candidate that cannot be anchored there is slop: drop it or escalate it as a question). Prefer small, isolated, high-evidence items. Give each survivor a **stable identity anchored on its primary file path** plus a short symptom — `<primary-relfile>::<short-symptom>`, e.g. `scripts/diff_extract.py::quotepath-parsing`. Anchor on the file, NOT free wording: the file path is the invariant a re-run will rediscover, so it is what makes the same defect dedup across runs (the seam fingerprints it, so exact formatting does not matter). Keep the `::` separator: the file component (its basename) now also anchors a fuzzy same-file dedup pass, so a re-discovery phrased differently still converges. Flag `hot` if it touches `SKILL.md` / `stage-registry.toml` / `CLAUDE.md` / a wired handler, OR a safety-machinery guard file (`lease.py`, `snapshot.py`, `_atomicio.py`, `_locking.py`, `state.py`, `dispatch_stage.py`, `diff_extract.py`, `machinery_edit.py`, `flow_friction.py`): a guard change must ride the hot path so the guard-property review gates it (the in-run merge reviewer when the run self-merges, or the §drain reap guard-property-check for an orphan). Parallel to `hot`, flag **`tier:trivial`** when the finding is mechanical, tightly bounded, behavior-preserving, and non-`hot` — work a capable cheaper model handles safely (a one-line doc-drift fix, a proven-dead-code deletion). Flag the weaker **`tier:light`** when the finding is non-`hot` AND small-footprint — at most 2 planned files, no touched file over ~500 lines, and no guard/cross-file seam work — AND it is behavior-**preserving** OR behavior-changing with NO checkable spec invariant. Read SIZE is the first cheap-model-failure axis (the 2x2 findings put read size, not task difficulty, as the predictor); a behavior change carrying a **checkable spec invariant** is the second, orthogonal one. **Exclude** from `tier:light` any **behavior-changing** finding that carries a **checkable spec invariant** — a DoD assertion verifiable against actual output/fixtures: a sign, unit, rounding, ordering, count, or stated bound ("all amounts positive"). Such a finding omits the tier label entirely, so per-key model resolution (`evolve_select.py`) falls through to `[evolve] worker_model` / the launcher default (opus) rather than `sonnet`. The witness: PR #2809 (silent-wrong) vs #2813 (correct) — small footprint, sonnet-eligible by size, but a sign invariant the cheap model got wrong and a self-confirming snapshot test masked. **Premise (stated, not circular):** this exclusion is applied by the strong-model producer (audit/propose runs at opus), so its efficacy is bounded by producer invariant-detection — that is the intended bound (an opus producer reading FT-1191 would not have stamped it cheap), not a hidden assumption. `tier:trivial` SUBSUMES `tier:light`: a mechanical behavior-preserving change has no behavior invariant to violate, so trivial is the stronger claim. Keep both labels available but never double-stamp one bead — pick the strongest claim that holds. Both are mutually exclusive with `hot`: a finding is either harness-risky (`hot`) or cheap-and-safe (`tier:trivial`/`tier:light`), never both. Producers re-check the file-size bound at the freshness gate (step 3) — sizes drift as the repo churns. A `tier:trivial` OR `tier:light` stamp lets drain run that bead's whole run at a cheaper worker model (§drain step C); per-key model resolves hot-first: a `hot` bead inherits the launcher default; a non-`hot` `tier:trivial` OR `tier:light` bead maps to `sonnet`; otherwise the run takes `[evolve] worker_model` when set, else inherits the launcher default.

The SAME tier stamp also scales the run's **verification depth**, not just its model (`scripts/tier_policy.py` maps labels → a `lane`: `tier:trivial` → `express`, `tier:light` → `light`, everything incl. `hot` → `full`). The lane operationalizes the xqt verdict ("bound the machinery to high-complexity/hot work"): because a tier stamp is a vetted producer judgment, a tier run does NOT re-run that judgment. `express` skips the spec-time confidence probe + the plan-revision round (verb-spec.md `--auto` step 4-5), relaxes the implement stage's mandatory-new-test for behavior-preserving work, and collapses the reflect stage to friction-log-only; `light` skips the confidence probe and collapses reflect only when the run hit no friction, but keeps TDD (it can be behavior-changing). The independent review (CI + the review bot) and the deterministic safety machinery (lease / snapshot / content-ownership / push-state) run on every lane — the lane drops re-judgment, never the net. `flow_worktree.py` stamps the resolved lane into the run frontmatter at bootstrap so the stages read one field; the spec-time gates resolve it directly via `triage.py lane`.
<!-- SYNC: this 9-file hot guard list is duplicated by design in references/stage-reflect.md step 2b — keep both in sync (flow-837; not extracted to a constant per maintainer decision) -->

### 3. File each candidate (dedup through the seam)

For each candidate, file it into flow's beads. The `--dedup-key` is the stable `id`; it stops refiling open work AND re-proposing findings already closed or rejected, so the loop converges:

**Freshness gate — before any `bd create`.** The miners read the maintainer checkout, which can lag `origin/<default>`; a finding can ship upstream between mining and filing. Once per filing batch, fetch and resolve the default branch the same way `flow_worktree.py create --base @default` does, including the unset-`origin/HEAD` fallback:

```bash
git fetch --quiet origin
DEFAULT=$(git symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD) \
  || { git remote set-head origin --auto >/dev/null; DEFAULT=$(git symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD); }
```

Then re-verify each candidate's evidence AT that ref, not the working checkout: a `file:line` cite → `git show "$DEFAULT:<path>"` and confirm the cited content is still there; a claimed-missing artifact (a test, a flag, a doc section) → `git grep <symbol-or-name> "$DEFAULT" -- <scope>` and confirm it is genuinely absent at the ref. A candidate whose ask already exists on `origin/<default>` is dropped before filing (count it in the step-4 report), not filed-then-caught at plan time. Prior art: flow-5ba (the audit filed a bead asking for a test PR#189 had already merged — the evidence snapshot predated the merge), flow-cam (a claimed-missing test was a grep miss — the at-ref `git grep` is what re-verifies a "missing" claim by command, not memory); the plan stage's drift-vs-@default discipline (flow-749) is the downstream net this gate front-runs. `flow_beads_create.py` stays dedup-only (the `evid:`/`evidfile:` fingerprints); it cannot verify a semantic claim like "test X is absent", so freshness is the filer's duty here.

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/flow_beads_create.py \
  --workspace-root . \
  --summary "<finding title>" \
  --description "<evidence (file:line / repro) + value + blast radius>" \
  --type <bug|chore|task> --labels evolve \
  --dedup-key "<primary-relfile>::<short-symptom>"
```

When the candidate was flagged `tier:trivial` (step 2), add it to the `--labels` value: `--labels "evolve,tier:trivial"`. A `tier:light` candidate is identical: `--labels "evolve,tier:light"`. No script change — `flow_beads_create.py` comma-splits `--labels`, so the extra label passes straight through onto the bead.

A `tier:light` finding is, by the step-2 rule, behavior-preserving OR behavior-changing-with-no-checkable-invariant; the behavior-changing-with-a-checkable-invariant class is excluded (it goes to opus, untiered). But a `tier:light` finding that IS behavior-changing (just without a sign/unit/rounding/ordering bound the cheap model could miss) still has a stated definition of done — record it so a green-but-wrong PR is correlatable to what it was supposed to satisfy. Pass the DoD assertion as `--acceptance-invariant "<the assertion>"`; it is appended to the bead description as a single-line `ACCEPTANCE-INVARIANT:` stem (the established marker pattern), which the ship-event reader (`references/stage-reflect.md`) pulls back out and records on the durable ship event:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/flow_beads_create.py \
  --workspace-root . \
  --summary "<finding title>" \
  --description "<evidence + value + blast radius>" \
  --type <bug|chore|task> --labels "evolve,tier:light" \
  --dedup-key "<primary-relfile>::<short-symptom>" \
  --acceptance-invariant "<the DoD assertion the cheap-tier run must satisfy>"
```

The `--dedup-key` is reduced to a deterministic `evid:` fingerprint, so re-runs that phrase the same defect differently still collide on the same key.
- Exit 0 → filed; prints the new bead key.
- Exit 5 → a bead for this fingerprint already exists (open or closed); prints that key. Skip — do NOT refile. This is the normal converged path on a re-run.
- Exit 4 → not maintainer (should not happen after the Gate). Exit 2 → bd error; report and continue.

### 4. Report

Summarise: candidates found, filed (with keys), skipped-as-duplicate, dropped-as-noise, dropped-as-already-shipped (stale evidence — the freshness gate in step 3). Be honest if the audit found little — a quiet run as the easy wins drain is success (the loop is self-limiting), not failure. Do not manufacture findings to fill the report.

The user reviews the backlog (`bd ready --label evolve`) and ships from it — or runs `/flow evolve drain` to drain it autonomously.

---

## drain

The consumer. A single LOOP that drains the whole backlog: each turn reaps finished orphans, launches the next startable batch, then waits while runs are live — repeating until nothing is startable. Post-Layer-2 each launched run self-merges its own green PR in-session (the `merge` stage, `references/stage-merge.md`), so `drain` does not merge live work itself; its reap step is the orphan safety-net (runs that died before self-merging), and its launch step starts new runs. Hot beads drain **sequentially** (serialized by `hot_inflight`), one landing before the next starts. The Gate above already ran.

### The loop

Repeat the turn below until step **D** returns `done`. If the user invoked `/flow evolve drain --include-proposals` (the dangerous mode, §`--include-proposals` below), append `--include-proposals` to BOTH the `evolve_reap.py` (step **A**) and `evolve_drain.py` (step **B**) invocations every turn — the reap flag is not optional, it is what lets a proposal orphan reap (without it those PRs pile up unmerged).

**A. Reap — merge orphan green leaf PRs (safety-net), first each turn.** Reaping first frees backpressure (open-PR cap) and clears `hot_inflight` for a hot that just landed, so the launch step sees an honest picture.

A launched run self-merges its own green PR, so this only ever finds a green evolve PR whose run **died before self-merging**. Green LEAF evolve PRs merge to the default branch unattended (immediate on green). Non-green and conflicted PRs always wait as draft PRs for the human — the gate survives where the risk is. A green DIRTY (conflicted) PR routes to `blocked` (reason `"DIRTY"`): branches no longer carry a version line (server-side `version-stamp.yml` stamps main post-merge), so a DIRTY is a genuine code conflict that belongs to a human. Hot PRs auto-merge ONLY under `[evolve] auto_merge_hot` (default off; on solely in this maintainer self-target repo) AND isolation: at most one hot PR merges per pass, and the fleet must be quiesced around the pass. Off / non-maintainer keeps today's behavior (hot → `skipped_hot`). Note: the code (`classify`) enforces only the one-hot-per-pass serialization; ensuring no other evolve run is active (quiescing the fleet) before an auto-merge pass is the operator's responsibility.

**Main-CI health gate (per turn).** Before any promotion, the reap probes main's OWN CI health for the sha at the tip of the default branch (`main_ci_health.py`, reusing `forge_github._classify_rollup`). When main is genuinely **red** (`failed`), every would-be-merge — the promoted hot and every non-hot leaf — routes into `held_main_red` instead of `merge` (held, not merged), no hot promotes this turn, and the reap files ONE deduped P0 naming the failing sha + check(s) (at most one open at a time; it refiles after a human closes it). Green, pending, and a transient probe `error` (a gh 401 / network flake) all resume normally — only a genuine red pauses. The Report (§Report) names the `held_main_red` set + the P0 bead key.

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/launch_ledger.py prune --workspace-root .  # hygiene: drop expired launch markers
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/evolve_reap.py --workspace-root .
```

Returns JSON `{merge:[{pr,key,is_draft,is_hot,covers}], not_green, skipped_hot, skipped_live, blocked, held_main_red}`. Each `merge` (and `held_main_red`) entry carries `covers`: the cover keys this PR co-delivers, parsed from the lead's `Closes <COVER>` commit trailers (the lead's own key filtered out), empty `[]` for an un-folded PR. The reap closes each cover after the lead close (below), so an ORPHANED folded lead (its run died before self-merging, §B2) still closes its covers — the common path closes them in the lead's own merge stage (`references/stage-merge.md` §Cover-close). The reap is lease-liveness-gated in code: a green PR whose run lease still reads live/corrupt is held in `skipped_live` (not merged) — the live run self-merges its own PR in its merge stage, so the reap only touches genuinely non-live (orphan) runs. The `launch_ledger.py prune` on the first line is hygiene only (drops expired launch markers); SKIP it under `--dry-run` like every other side effect, since it deletes files. For each `merge` entry (skip all of this under `--dry-run`):

**Guard property-check — run FIRST for any entry with `is_hot: true`.** A hot entry touches the harness, possibly the safety machinery itself. Before merging it, review the PR diff (`gh pr diff <pr>`) against the guard-property checklist: does this DELETE or weaken a safety property — lease exclusivity (one run per ticket), snapshot drift-detection, atomic-write + corrupt-file quarantine, content-ownership refusal, or self-edit flock serialization? Guard *code* may be refactored, sped up, or improved freely; a guard *property* may only be replaced by one that provably still holds, never simply dropped. Green does NOT prove the property holds — most of these have no direct test — so this review is the enforcer, not CI. If the diff removes a protection without a provably-equivalent replacement → do NOT merge: leave the PR as a draft for the human (skip its `gh pr ready` + `gh pr merge`), and report it under `held_guard`. Only a property-preserving hot entry proceeds to the steps below; a non-hot entry (`is_hot: false`) skips straight to them.

```bash
# mark ready only if it was a draft, then squash-merge
gh pr ready <pr>        # only when is_draft is true
# fleet re-check (flow-8by2.3): classify ran lock-free turns ago; a run that acquired
# a lease in the classify->merge gap must NOT have its PR merged + bead closed out
# from under it (the worst TOCTOU, flow-72d9). is-live is lease-only (a dead orphan's
# fleet entry outlives its lease, so an OR would skip a reapable orphan) and fail-safe
# (exit 0 = live = SKIP). On skip, leave it: next pass re-classifies.
if python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fleet.py is-live --key <key> --workspace-root .; then
  echo "fleet: <key> went live after classify — not merging this turn"
else
  # squash-merge WITHOUT --delete-branch, then close the bead and delete the
  # remote branch — both gated on the merge succeeding, neither on the other.
  if gh pr merge <pr> --squash; then
    bd close <key> --reason "merged via PR #<pr>"
    # close any covered beads this folded lead co-delivered. <covers> is the merge
    # entry's `covers` list (the lead's `Closes <COVER>` commit trailers, lead key
    # filtered out). Best-effort, mirroring the lead close; never block the reap.
    for COVER in <covers>; do
      python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tracker_cli.py --workspace-root . \
        comment --key "$COVER" --text "co-delivered by <key> via PR #<pr>" || true
      python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/tracker_cli.py --workspace-root . \
        transition --key "$COVER" --to-state closed || true
      bd dep remove "$COVER" <key> || true   # drop the §B2 suppression dep (beads-only; harmless if absent)
    done
    git push origin --delete <branch> || true
  fi
fi
# reap owns the LOCAL worktree + local branch (lease-gated; also re-checks the lease)
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/flow_worktree.py reap --ticket <key> --branch <branch> --main-root .
```

`<key>`, `<pr>`, and `<branch>` (== `headRefName`) all come from the `merge` entry. `--delete-branch` is dropped: gh's branch-delete step fails because the still-registered worktree under `.flow/worktrees/` holds the local `feat/<key>-*` branch checked out, and that failure makes an otherwise-successful `gh pr merge` exit 1 — which short-circuited the old `&& bd close`, so the bead never closed and the remote branch was left undeleted. Now `gh pr merge --squash` alone exits 0 on a clean merge, so `bd close` runs; the remote branch is deleted explicitly with `git push origin --delete <branch>` (which also drops the local `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` tracking ref that feeds `evolve_select._gather_refs`). Deleting the REMOTE ref is unaffected by the worktree holding the LOCAL branch. `bd close` and the remote delete are each gated on the merge succeeding and are independent of each other (separate statements inside the `if`, never chained behind one another), so a `bd close` hiccup never skips the remote delete. `gh pr merge` refuses a not-actually-mergeable PR, so it is a safe backstop if state changed since the classify; if it refuses, the `if` body is skipped and the bead stays open. Closing a bead whose PR never merged would mint the exact PR↔bead state-inconsistency this step exists to prevent. The `reap` step still owns the LOCAL worktree + local branch teardown. It is lease-gated: a worktree whose bg session is still running (typically the reflect stage, which runs after the PR is green) is SKIPPED and reaped on a later turn once the session ends.

`bd close` here autodiscovers `.beads/*.db` from cwd, and this sub-verb is maintainer-gated with no `cd` in the loop, so the close inherits the maintainer-repo cwd and hits flow's own DB. With the close wired in, reaping a PR also closes its bead, so the loop leaves no merged-but-open beads behind. Veto for the human: convert a PR to draft or close it before the next turn and the reap skips it.

**A2. Cleanup finished sessions — stop + tombstone the idle done ones.** A launched `claude --bg /flow <key> --auto` run does not exit when its work finishes: after the PR merges + the reflect stage runs, the session goes idle but lingers as a job dir under `~/.claude/jobs/<id>/`, so a multi-bead drain leaves a pile of idle sessions in the agents panel for the maintainer to `claude stop` + Ctrl+X by hand. This step clears them. It is read-only classification + reviewable prose side effects (mirrors step A reap).

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/evolve_session_cleanup.py --workspace-root . --self-job "$(basename "$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR")"
```

Enumeration + liveness are filesystem-only — the script scans `~/.claude/jobs/*/state.json` directly and NEVER calls `claude agents --json` (it blocks on a TTY and the drain can run headless). Flags: `--workspace-root` (required; non-maintainer → exit 4, skip this step), `--self-job` (the orchestrator's own `$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR` basename, skipped outright), `--idle-threshold-secs` (default 300; a transcript with a fresher mtime is treated as still writing → not stopped), `--stale-idle-threshold-secs` (default 600; the longer idle bar applied when `state` is not a clean terminal — see below). It returns JSON `{stoppable:[{session_id, job_id, key, cwd, job_dir, reason}], skipped:[{session_id, reason}]}` — the `job_id` (the 8-hex dir basename) is the `claude stop` handle, NOT the session UUID. The session→bead map is the job's `intent` (`/flow <key> --auto`), which also filters out foreign / non-flow jobs; the bg orchestrator records `cwd == repo root` (not the worktree), so a job is eligible only when its cwd is this repo's root. A session reaches `stoppable` only when its `<key>`'s bead is terminal (closed/blocked/deferred), `tempo ∈ {idle, blocked}` (a bg run that DIED blocked — rate limit, permission ask, auth outage — rests at `tempo == blocked` forever, and the terminal-bead gate separates that dead zombie from a genuine needs-input run whose bead is still open; any other non-idle tempo like `active` is real work → skipped), its run lease is non-live (`live`/`corrupt` → skipped, the same mid-reflect guard reap uses; an already-reaped worktree reads `absent` → non-live → proceeds), and its transcript mtime is idle — any busy or unprovable signal skips it (fail-safe toward NOT stopping). `state` is deliberately NOT gated: a finished bg run rests at `state == working` (or `blocked`) indefinitely — a `session_cron` keepalive task, or a daemon that never flips the field — so gating on `done`/`stopped` skipped the COMMON case and leaked every drained run as a zombie. Doneness rests on the three independent signals (lease ∧ transcript ∧ bead) instead; when `state` is not a clean terminal, the transcript must be idle past the longer `--stale-idle-threshold-secs` before the stale field is overridden.

For each `stoppable` entry (skip ALL of this under `--dry-run` — print the stoppable set and run nothing):

```bash
# validate tokens before interpolating (defensive on the destructive path)
# fleet re-check (flow-8by2.3): classify ran turns ago; a session that re-acquired a
# lease in the classify->stop gap must NOT be stopped + tombstoned mid-work (the
# central lock-free classify->mutate gap, the one destructive path with no under-flock
# re-check today). is-live is lease-only, fail-safe (exit 0 = live = SKIP).
if python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fleet.py is-live --key <key> --workspace-root .; then
  echo "fleet: <key> went live after classify — not stopping this session"
else
  timeout 90 claude stop <job_id> </dev/null || true     # the 8-hex JOB id is the stop handle; `claude stop <session_uuid>` fails "No job matching". stdin detached + bounded
  rm -rf <job_dir>                                        # Ctrl+X-equivalent: drop the panel tombstone (the absolute path from the entry)

`<job_id>`, `<session_id>`, and `<job_dir>` come from the `stoppable` entry. **`claude stop` takes the `<job_id>` (the 8-hex dir basename), NOT the session UUID** — passing the UUID returns "No job matching" fast (the bug that left a whole drain's runs un-stopped; the follow-up `rm` was then silently re-materialized by the daemon, because the session was never actually stopped). Before the `claude stop`, validate `<job_id>` is 8-hex (`^[0-9a-f]{8}$`). Before the `rm -rf`, validate `<job_dir>` is under `~/.claude/jobs/` with an 8-hex basename (`^.*/\.claude/jobs/[0-9a-f]{8}$`) — the single destructive line, so guard the path it deletes. Use the entry's literal `<job_dir>`. **Order matters: the stop must land BEFORE the `rm`** — a still-registered job dir that is `rm`-ed gets re-created by the daemon, so only a stopped (or genuinely done) job stays removed. This is NON-DESTRUCTIVE to history: the transcript at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session_id>.jsonl` is untouched, so the session stays resumable (`claude attach <session_id>`) after either stop or dir-removal. A daemon-sanctioned dismiss is the cleaner long-term path if a future CLI offers one (none in 2.1.169).

**A3. Escalate deferred no-question sonnet beads — reopen so the ladder retries at opus.** The §C launch-time ladder escalates only OPEN-bead DNFs (they re-appear in `bd ready`); a run that **defers WITHOUT a substantive open question** sets `status=deferred` and drops OUT of `bd ready`, so that ladder structurally cannot see it (the flow-recv CQ1 gap, flow-4hug). This step closes it: scan deferred beads and, for the no-question ones whose sonnet attempt is spent, REOPEN them (`status → open`) so the SAME §C ladder picks them up THIS same turn (steps B→C) and escalates to opus. It runs BEFORE **B** because B's `evolve_select` reads `bd ready` — a reopened bead must be visible to this turn's select. Read-only classification + reviewable prose side effects (mirrors A reap / A2 cleanup); skip the reopen under `--dry-run` (print the would-reopen set only).

For each `status=deferred` bead (`bd list --status deferred --json --limit 0` — without `--limit 0`, `bd list` silently truncates at 50 and a deferred backlog past that drops its lowest-priority beads from this scan; maintainer/beads-only) that is **sonnet-tiered** — carries a `tier:trivial` OR `tier:light` label AND is non-`hot` (HOT-FIRST precedence: a `hot` bead with a tier label is NOT sonnet-tiered and is never escalated here; this replicates the §C `model_per_key[key] == "sonnet"` resolution from labels directly, because `model_per_key` is not computed until B):

1. `bd show <key> --include-comments`. Find the NEWEST `flow --auto could not self-approve` comment and extract its `[defer-reason: X]` tag (verb-spec.md stamps it at defer-and-exit time).
2. **`open-question`, OR no `[defer-reason: ...]` tag at all** (a pre-marker defer, or a defer carrying a substantive question) → LEAVE deferred — the normal `/flow triage` path where a human answers. Skip; do NOT reopen.
3. **`no-question`** → branch on the NEWEST `SONNET-LADDER:` marker (the SAME shared attempt counter §C uses — a sonnet attempt's two failure exits, open-bead DNF and defer-no-question, share one counter):
   - **`SONNET-LADDER: sonnet-attempt-1`** (the sonnet attempt is spent, no opus attempt yet) → **REOPEN**: `bd update <key> --status open`. The bead re-enters `bd ready`; this turn's **B** select sees it and **C**'s ladder, reading the same `sonnet-attempt-1` marker, escalates it to opus (writes `opus-attempt-2`). **A3 writes NO marker** — it only flips status; §C owns the opus-escalation marker write, so the shared counter stays single-owner (no double-count).
   - **`SONNET-LADDER: opus-attempt-2`** (already escalated, and the opus attempt deferred-no-question too) → LEAVE deferred (parked for the human; surfaces in `/flow triage`). Do NOT reopen — re-running opus on a no-question give-up just re-loops.
   - **no `SONNET-LADDER:` marker** → LEAVE deferred (can't confirm a laddered sonnet attempt; conservative — a human handles it at triage). The fail-safe default is toward NOT escalating, matching the §C CQ2 accepted-false-negatives posture.

Once reopened, the bead is a normal open bead and the existing §C machinery owns the escalation — A3's only job is the status flip.

**B. Decide the next action.**

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/evolve_drain.py --workspace-root .
```

This runs `evolve_select` (which is DAG-aware via `bd ready`, drops in-flight beads, enforces backpressure ≥ `cap` open PRs, partitions ≤1 hot per batch / no shared primary-file anchor) and annotates each in-flight bead with its run's lease liveness. It returns JSON `{action: "launch"|"recover"|"wait"|"done", launch:[keys], stranded:[keys], stranded_pre_pr:[{key,branch,worktree}], parked:[keys], liveness:{}, select:{...}}` (the top-level `stranded` key rides only the `recover` action; `stranded_pre_pr` is always present, empty when nothing is stranded). Inside `select`, `launched_pending` lists the keys held by the launch ledger — runs fanned out on a prior turn that have not yet registered a branch/lease (the launch→init window); the selector already counts them as in-flight, so they are neither re-launched nor allowed to break hot isolation.

- **`launch`** (launch non-empty) → go to **C**.
- **`recover`** (launch empty, `stranded_pre_pr` non-empty) → run the **§Recover stranded pre-PR runs** recipe below, then loop immediately back to **A** (no Monitor-wait — the recovery is local, the next turn's select sees the reopened beads). A stranded entry is a `/flow <key> --auto` run that died PRE-PR: its bead sits in_progress with a dirty orphan worktree but no lease and no PR, so every other channel (reap is PR-only, A2 needs a terminal bead, the §C ladder needs an OPEN bead) reads it as gone and the loop would false-positive to `done`. `recover` outranks `wait`: it only touches the stranded bead's own dead worktree (fleet-rechecked first), so a live run blocking elsewhere does not defer it.
- **`wait`** (launch empty, but a **blocking** in-flight run remains) → go to **D-wait**. A run blocks when its lease reads `live` OR `corrupt`: a live run will self-merge and free serialization/backpressure; a corrupt lease (run.lock unparseable, ownership unconfirmable) does NOT self-free — it blocks until a human runs `recover takeover`. A non-empty `launched_pending` is a third blocking reason: a launched-but-pre-lease run (in the ledger, no branch/lease/PR registered yet) has no run dir to read, so it would otherwise look non-blocking — it blocks until it registers (then the lease/PR channels take over) or its marker TTL-expires. It is NOT parked. All route to **D-wait**.
- **`done`** (launch empty AND `launched_pending` empty AND `stranded_pre_pr` empty AND no in-flight run is blocking — none reads `live` or `corrupt` — backlog drained, or only parked-for-human work remains) → exit the loop, go to **Report**. The stranded gate is load-bearing: the loop NEVER reads `done` while a true stranded pre-PR bead exists, so the false-positive termination (a pre-PR-dead run leaving its bead silently in_progress, witnessed flow-mmh3) cannot recur.

The termination is blocking-gated on purpose: a **withheld** hot bead (its in-run reviewer raised `held_guard`) leaves a ready PR + branch but its session has ended, so its lease is expired/absent (non-blocking) — it reads as `parked`, never `wait`, so the loop cannot spin on it. The other blocking states are `corrupt` (treated live-equivalent because an in-flight run that cannot be confirmed dead must never let the loop drain to `done`; a corrupt lease blocks until a human runs `recover takeover`) and a `launched_pending` key (a just-launched run still in its pre-lease bootstrap window, which must not be abandoned with a hot bead held behind it). It terminates and hands the withheld bead (plus any hot beads stuck behind it in `held_hot`) to the human.

**§Recover stranded pre-PR runs.** On a `recover` action, act on each entry in the step-**B** JSON's `stranded_pre_pr` (`{key, branch, worktree}`), then loop back to **A**. Each entry is a bead `evolve_drain.py` classified STRANDED: in_progress (evolve-label-scoped, so a day-job run's worktree in the shared pool is never touched), lease non-live, not in `launched_pending`, and with NO PR open or merged. Recovery tears down the dirty worktree and reopens the bead so the NEXT turn's select relaunches it FRESH off `origin/main` — it NEVER do-resumes the dirty worktree (the do-resume re-dies at implement entry: `records_diff_baseline --capture-blobs` runs against planned files already deleted-in-worktree-but-present-in-HEAD, witnessed flow-mmh3 attempt 2). Skip ALL side effects under `--dry-run` (print the `stranded_pre_pr` set, run nothing). For each entry:

```bash
# fleet re-check FIRST (flow-8by2.3, as A-reap / A2-cleanup): classify ran lock-free
# turns ago; a bead that re-acquired a lease in the classify->recover gap must NOT have

```

`<key>` comes from the entry. **Reap-then-reopen / reap-then-block is the load-bearing order in EVERY branch:** if the reap partially fails the bead stays in_progress → re-qualifies as stranded next turn → idempotent self-heal (the marker doesn't advance because the marker write is `&&`-gated on a clean reap). Reopen/block-first then a reap failure would make the bead `open`/`blocked` + a dirty worktree still present → invisible to the in_progress detector, and the next-turn launch hits dup-claim exit 4 forever. After a clean reopen the bead is `open` (back in `bd ready`) with its worktree gone, so this turn's loop-back to **A** → **B** select sees it and **C** launches it fresh. **The `STRANDED-RECOVERY:` marker bounds the cycle at TWO recovery relaunches** (no marker → relaunch + `attempt-1`; `attempt-1` → relaunch + `attempt-2`; `attempt-2` → block + triage stem, terminal — a `blocked` bead leaves in_progress so it drops out of the detector and never re-strands). This is the tier-uniform inner bound that closes the deterministic-crasher loop (the marker is distinct from SONNET-LADDER, so a sonnet bead carrying both counters is bounded by whichever trips first). The loop-level iteration cap (the guaranteed terminal exit D-wait names) remains the outer bound for a flapping `bd update`.

**B2. Group-fold the launch batch (≥2 keys).** When step **B** returns `launch` with **two or more** keys, cluster the ones that are *one coherent change* and rewrite the launch plan so each cluster becomes a single lead-`--covers` run — related beads do NOT launch as colliding parallel runs (the flow-n7lz collision: `flow-x1yq`/`flow-nr8c`/`flow-pms6` all rewriting `create_pr.py` launched in one batch). A singleton batch (one key) skips this step; the plan is unchanged. This is a deterministic, prose-orchestrated pass over the keys already in hand — NO agent spawn by default (it mirrors `/flow group`'s clustering, which is pure prose). **B2 does NOT launch** — it only clusters, wires the cover suppression, and produces the *effective launch plan* that **C** executes. This keeps ONE launch site (no double-launch) and gives each fold-lead all of C's machinery (the clean-boundary advance, the per-key `triage.py decided` / staleness check, the sonnet ladder).

Cluster by the cheap signals available at select time, any one of which couples two launch keys:
- an explicit `bd dep` edge between two of the launch keys (`bd dep tree <key> --json`, or read the candidate `links`),
- a **shared parent epic** (same `parent` on both beads), OR
- a **shared primary file matched by BASENAME STEM** — e.g. both bodies name `create_pr.py`. Match the stem, NOT the full path: `nr8c` phrases it as `create_pr.py::raw-commit-body`, so a full-path (`scripts/create_pr.py`) signal misses it and would half-fold the trio, re-opening the exact collision this fixes.

A cluster = a set of ≥2 keys joined (transitively) by those signals. For each cluster:
1. **Pick the lead** — reuse `verb-group.md`'s rule: prefer an in-progress / WIP-branch member, else the most substantive body. The lead owns the run identity; the rest become its covers.
2. **Suppress the covers** so neither this turn's **C** nor the NEXT turn's select re-launches them: `bd dep <lead> --blocks <cover>` per cover (the bd form is `bd dep <blocker> --blocks <blocked>`). This drops each cover from `bd ready` and keeps it off the §Recover stranded detector (which requires `in_progress`, not `blocked`). Self-heals if the lead dies: a recovered solo lead eventually closes, the covers unblock and re-cluster.
3. **Rewrite the launch plan:** DROP every cover key from the keys **C** will launch, and tag the lead with its cover set. So the effective plan = singletons (keys in no ≥2 cluster) + one lead per cluster, the lead carrying `covers=[c1,c2]`.

The lead's run self-merges its own PR and closes every cover at merge (`references/stage-merge.md` §Cover-close); an orphaned lead's covers close at reap (§A above). Under `--dry-run`, print the fold plan (each cluster's lead + its covers, and the surviving singletons) and wire NOTHING — no `bd dep`, no launch. A synthetic 2-bead same-file batch must show ONE folded `--covers` launch, not two.

Clustering stays prose (judgment, like `/flow group`): default to the deterministic signals above; only escalate to a clustering Agent when a large batch leaves an ambiguous grouping the cheap signals cannot resolve.

**C. Launch.** Launch the **effective plan** from **B2** (singletons + one lead per fold-cluster; for a singleton batch the plan is just step **B**'s `launch`). A fold-lead carries a `covers` set — append `--covers <c1>,<c2>` to its `claude --bg` command (cover keys comma-joined); a singleton carries none and launches bare.

**Pre-launch advance (clean-boundary, conditional).** Before fanning out this batch, advance the maintainer checkout when — and only when — nothing is mid-pipeline, so the about-to-launch runs pick up just-merged code (same-drain compounding instead of next-drain: a fix merged earlier this drain, e.g. a bare-`git push` fix or a lease-heartbeat, governs the very next batch rather than waiting for the next drain). The gate, read from the step-**B** JSON you already consumed: no `liveness` value is `live` or `corrupt` (equivalently `select.live_runs` is empty) AND `select.launched_pending` is empty. When it holds, run the **§Post-drain advance recipe** below (`git fetch` + `git checkout -- .beads/` + `git merge --ff-only origin/main` → `claude plugin marketplace update vdsmon-flow`, try-and-skip, **never force**), then proceed to the launch loop; it inherits §Post-drain's carve-outs (skip under `--dry-run`, skip when the orchestrator is not on `main`). When the gate does NOT hold — any `live`/`corrupt` lease, or a non-empty `launched_pending` — **skip** the advance and launch on the current checkout: a running session reads its stage reference docs on demand, so swapping the checkout underfoot mid-pipeline could change a stage's prose beneath an in-flight run. The advance lands BEFORE the `launch_ledger.py add` / `claude --bg` loop so the just-launched runs see the freshly-advanced plugin; the unconditional final advance still runs at §Post-drain when the loop exits.

**Pre-launch staleness check (per key, judgment).** Before applying any staleness judgment, run the decision probe for each key:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/triage.py decided --workspace-root . --key <key>
```

If `decided=true` AND the bead is open: the maintainer has already adjudicated this work — do NOT re-defer, do NOT close as stale, do NOT apply any hold judgment. Launch it immediately (this is the orchestrator-side guard that prevents the staleness check from silently killing a decided-open bead before the `--auto` run ever sees it; the run-side decision ingest at the end of this section is a separate, complementary step that runs inside the launched session). A decided bead that re-appears open after the orchestrator itself previously deferred it is maintainer intent — honor it and launch. Hot-bead safety checks still apply: a decided hot bead must respect the one-hot-per-batch isolation limit and the merge-time guard review; "honor" means launch the run, not skip safety checks.

Then, before launching each surviving non-decided key, sanity-check whether anything since the bead was filed has already invalidated it — a PR merged this drain (or earlier), a just-closed sibling bead, or a config/environment/operator action the orchestrator itself took this session (it may have diagnosed or fixed the very root cause the bead addresses). This is the gap the audit-freshness gate structurally cannot cover: that gate catches beads staled by CODE landing on `origin/main` because it diffs against base, but environment/config fixes, closed siblings, and operator actions never show up in a diff. When a key is stale, do NOT launch it — close it with the reason instead (`bd close <key> --reason "<why it is moot — e.g. root cause already config-fixed this drain: gh keyring contention, token moved to hosts.yml>"`) and drop it from the batch. This is a judgment call the orchestrator makes from context it already holds, not a script gate; fan out only the keys that survive it.

For each key in the **effective plan** (the §B2 rewrite: singletons + one lead per fold-cluster — NOT step **B**'s raw `launch`, whose cover keys §B2 dropped) (under `--dry-run`, print the command instead of running it). Read the per-key worker model from the step-**B** JSON (`result.select.model_per_key[key]`, present in the same JSON you already consumed) and append `--model <model>` when the key is present (resolved hot-first: a `hot` bead maps to `[evolve] worker_model` when configured — an explicit pin, so the opus judgment layer is real rather than a maybe-Fable launcher default — else omits the flag; a non-`hot` `tier:trivial` OR `tier:light` bead maps to `sonnet`; else `[evolve] worker_model` when set, otherwise omit and inherit the launcher default). When the key is a §B2 fold-lead, append `--covers <c1>,<c2>` (its cover set, comma-joined):

```bash
# record the launch FIRST so the very next turn's select sees this key as in-flight
# even before it registers a branch/lease (closes the re-launch + 2nd-hot-isolation window).
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/launch_ledger.py add --key <key> --workspace-root .
# shadow-register the launch in the fleet liveness ledger (epic flow-8by2; child-3 reads it).
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fleet.py register --key <key> --workspace-root .
claude --bg [--model sonnet] "/flow <key> --auto [--covers <c1>,<c2>]"
```

A producer-stamped `tier:trivial` OR `tier:light` non-`hot` bead maps to `sonnet`, so its whole run (orchestrator + plan/implement subagents) runs at the cheaper worker tier; a non-tiered non-`hot` bead maps to `[evolve] worker_model` when configured (this repo: `opus`); a `hot` bead ALSO maps to `[evolve] worker_model` when configured (this repo: `opus`) — pinned explicitly so its opus judgment layer (inline `code_review`, the §6A merge reviewer, the `--auto` ship gate) is real, since a hot bead follows the opus-plans/sonnet-writes split with its work subagents downshifted via `model_resolve.py` — and omits the flag only when no `worker_model` is set. Under `--dry-run`, the printed would-launch command shows the chosen `--model` so a downshift is visible before anything launches.

**Sonnet escalation ladder (per sonnet-tiered key).** A `sonnet`-resolved run (a `tier:trivial`/`tier:light` key, i.e. `model_per_key[key] == "sonnet"`) that DNFs on context/rate-limit/infra leaves its bead OPEN (verb-spec.md flow-aod: a context/rate-limit/infra DNF never transitions the bead, so it re-appears in `bd ready` next drain turn). That re-appearance IS the DNF signal — no reap or session-cleanup detection is needed (reap is PR-only; A2 gates on a terminal bead). Before launching each such key, read `bd show <key> --include-comments` and look for a marker comment under the DISTINCT stem `SONNET-LADDER:` (it must NOT collide with the `DECISION:` / `TRIAGE-DECISION:` / `flow --auto could not self-approve` triage stems). Branch on the newest `SONNET-LADDER:` marker:

- **No `SONNET-LADDER:` marker** AND `model_per_key[key] == "sonnet"` → launch at `sonnet` as the selector resolved, then comment the marker (`tracker_cli.py ... comment --key <key> --text "SONNET-LADDER: sonnet-attempt-1"`).
- **`SONNET-LADDER: sonnet-attempt-1` present** (the key re-appeared ⇒ the sonnet attempt DNF'd) → **ESCALATE**: OVERRIDE the resolved model to `[evolve] worker_model` — pass `--model <worker_model>` (the explicit opus pin, same as a non-tiered bead; do NOT pass `--model sonnet`, and do NOT merely omit the flag, which could inherit a non-opus launcher default); omit `--model` only when no `worker_model` is set. Then comment the marker (`tracker_cli.py ... comment --key <key> --text "SONNET-LADDER: opus-attempt-2"`).
- **`SONNET-LADDER: opus-attempt-2` present** (second failure) → do NOT relaunch: comment a body that STARTS with the literal `flow --auto could not self-approve` triage stem and set status `blocked`, the same `tracker_cli.py ... comment --key <key> --text "flow --auto could not self-approve: ..."` + `bd update <key> --status blocked` pairing the spec-stage park uses (so it surfaces in `/flow triage`). Drop the key from this launch batch.

The marker is written by the live drain ORCHESTRATOR (the launcher), not the dying run, so a hard context-overflow death that writes nothing is fine — the orchestrator reads the bead's marker and the bead's `bd ready` re-appearance, both of which outlive the run. The override is launch-time logic that adjusts the already-consumed `model_per_key[key]` value before building the `claude --bg` command; the selectors (`evolve_select.py` / `queue_select.py`) stay pure no-side-effect functions and are NOT touched by this ladder. A non-escalating key — no tier label, `hot`, or a `worker_model`-resolved bead (`model_per_key[key] != "sonnet"`) — is NOT marked and NOT laddered; the ladder applies only to sonnet-tiered keys.

**CQ2 — the whole open-bead DNF class escalates.** The ticket names rate-limit, context-overflow, and infra as triggers, and all three leave the bead open, so the ladder cannot distinguish them — it escalates the whole open-bead DNF class. Accepted risk: a transient global rate-limit can burn an opus attempt and park an otherwise-good bead. This repo accepts those false negatives (a human un-parks at triage).

Downshifted runs stay **visible** for revert-correlation: the `tier:trivial`/`tier:light` bead label persists after close, so `bd list --status closed --label tier:trivial` and `--label tier:light` (closed-inclusive — a downshifted bead is closed by the time you would revert it) together list every downshifted bead, each matched to its `feat/<key>-*` branch / PR. That persistent label IS the record; a bad cheap-tier PR is found there, reverted, and the label removed to un-stamp the pattern. The label is the *backward-looking* half — it correlates a bad PR to its tier only after you already suspect it. For a behavior-changing `tier:light` downshift the recorded `acceptance_invariant` (filed via `--acceptance-invariant`, stamped onto the ship event at reflect time) is the *forward-looking* half: it states what the PR was supposed to satisfy, so a green-but-wrong downshift is matched to the assertion it violated instead of relying on the tier label plus hindsight.

Each spawns a detached run that auto-plans and either drives its PR to green-and-self-merged, or — when it cannot self-approve at ≥90% confidence — **defers** its bead in place (status → `deferred`, open questions commented) and exits. A deferred bead drops out of `bd ready`, so the loop stops relaunching it. Defer-and-exit is the intended unattended outcome, not a failure. Drain auto-picks decided beads (already triaged + reopened) via the recorded-decision marker — no command change; the `--auto` run self-detects the decision (verb-spec.md step 4) and ingests the answer instead of re-deferring on it. After launching, briefly wait (Monitor, short cap) until the new keys register a branch/PR so the next turn's select sees them as in-flight, then loop back to **A**.

**D-wait.** Nothing to launch yet, but a **blocking** run is in flight — either a `live`/`corrupt` lease, or a `launched_pending` key with no lease to event-wait on yet (still pre-lease in its launch→init window). Wait with the `Monitor` tool (foreground `sleep` is blocked) until a run settles — `open_pr_count` drops (a PR merged) OR a lease ceases to block (goes non-live, or a corrupt lease cleared by `recover takeover`) OR a launched_pending run registers a lease/PR (its marker is then removed) — capped at roughly a stage timeout; on the cap, loop back to **A** anyway (the next reap mops up a now-dead run, and a launched_pending key whose run never registered drops out once its marker TTL-expires). Then loop back to **A**. **Anti-spin discipline:** whatever the Monitor polls, its poll command carries a consecutive-error budget (default 3) that emits and breaks back to **A** instead of spinning when the poll itself errors repeatedly, and the iteration cap is the guaranteed terminal exit — never a bare `while true` with no error budget and no bound (the silent-infinite-spin failure mode). D-wait does NOT itself `ci-rollup`-poll: an in-flight run drives its own PR's CI via its own `review_loop`; D-wait waits on orchestration state (`open_pr_count` / lease / `launched_pending`), not a single PR's checks.

### --dry-run

`/flow evolve drain --dry-run`: run ONE turn's **A** reap classification (`evolve_reap.py`, print the `merge`/`not_green`/`skipped_hot`/`blocked`/`held_main_red` sets, do NOT merge) + **A2** session-cleanup classification (`evolve_session_cleanup.py`, print the `stoppable` set, do NOT `claude stop` or `rm`) + **A3** deferred-escalation classification (scan deferred sonnet beads, print the would-reopen set, do NOT `bd update --status open`) + **B** (`evolve_drain.py`, print the action + would-launch keys + parked) + **B2** group-fold (print the fold plan — each cluster's lead + covers — do NOT wire deps or launch), then STOP. No merges, no stops, no reopens, no dep-wiring, no launches, no loop, no post-`done` final session sweep.

### --include-proposals (dangerous)

`/flow evolve drain --include-proposals` widens the loop from the `evolve` backlog to **also auto-launch + reap plain `proposal` beads** — the judgment-side work (features, real refactors, reorgs) that §propose deliberately routes to the maintainer's own backlog so a human accepts it at the spec-plan gate. With this flag, each ready `proposal` bead is fanned out as a `/flow <key> --auto` run that self-plans and self-merges at ≥90% confidence, **bypassing that human accept**. This is the one place drain ships taste-and-fit work with no human in the loop; use it only when you genuinely want the proposal backlog drained autonomously.

Mechanically it threads through the whole turn: `evolve_select` pulls a second `bd ready -l proposal` candidate set (merged by id) and drops its proposal-exclusion guard; `evolve_drain.py --include-proposals` carries the flag into select and echoes `include_proposals: true` in its JSON; `evolve_reap.py --include-proposals` widens its label index so proposal **orphans** (runs that died before self-merging) reap too — pass it on the step **A** invocation or those PRs never merge. Hot proposals serialize on the same single hot slot as hot evolve beads. Composable with `--dry-run` to preview what the dangerous mode would launch. The Report (below) names `include_proposals: true` so a run that auto-drained judgment work says so.

### Post-drain: final session sweep (A2 tail)

When the loop exits (`done`), the LAST launched batch's `--auto` sessions have just finished — `done` fires the instant the last run's LEASE frees (step **B**), but a bg session goes idle only AFTER that (it still streams its final summary; `--auto` self-teardown is best-effort). The per-turn **A2** cleanup ran while that batch was still non-idle and skipped it, and no turn follows `done` — so without this step the last batch always leaks as agent-panel tombstones for the maintainer to `claude stop` by hand (flow-opnl). This sweep collects them.

At `done` EVERY lease is freed by definition, so the conservative per-turn A2 bar (the 600s `--stale-idle-threshold-secs` that guards a mid-drain session whose `state` still reads `working`/`blocked`) is unnecessary here: the three hard doneness signals (lease non-live ∧ tempo ∈ {idle, blocked} ∧ bead terminal) already hold. Run A2 with a SHORT idle bar so a just-finished session (idle only ~1-2 min) qualifies, in a BOUNDED poll (self-terminating — NOT a bare `while true`):

- Repeat up to 3 passes, ~45s apart (one self-contained bash loop with an internal `sleep 45`, ~3 min cap). Each pass classifies with BOTH bars short:
  ```bash
  python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/evolve_session_cleanup.py --workspace-root . \
    --self-job "$(basename "$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR")" \
    --idle-threshold-secs 45 --stale-idle-threshold-secs 45
  ```
  then stop + tombstone each `stoppable` entry with the IDENTICAL step-A2 recipe (fleet `is-live` recheck FIRST → validate `job_id` is 8-hex + `job_dir` is under `~/.claude/jobs/<8-hex>` → `claude stop <job_id>` BEFORE `rm -rf <job_dir>`).
- Stop early after a pass returns `stoppable: []` (the last batch has settled); otherwise stop at the cap — a straggler still non-idle at the cap is caught by the NEXT drain's per-turn A2, unchanged.
- **Skip this whole step under `--dry-run`** (print the would-sweep note only), like every other §drain side effect. Only this post-`done` sweep runs the short bars; the per-turn A2 default (600s) is untouched.

### Post-drain: advance the checkout (DEFAULT, always run)

When the loop exits (`done`), advance the maintainer checkout so the just-merged work goes live for the NEXT run. This is **default behaviour — always desirable, always run it** (the `vdsmon-flow` marketplace tracks the local `main` checkout, so an un-advanced checkout keeps serving the pre-drain code to every subsequent run). From the maintainer repo root, on `main`:

```bash
git fetch origin --quiet
# .beads/*.jsonl is a passive export (Dolt is truth) — discard its churn so ff-only is clean
git checkout -- .beads/ 2>/dev/null || true
if git merge --ff-only origin/main; then
  claude plugin marketplace update vdsmon-flow
else
  echo "ff-only skipped (checkout diverged/dirty) — advance by hand; NEVER force"
fi
```

Try-and-skip, **never force**: a diverged or dirty tree leaves the advance for the human, not a `--force`. Skip this step entirely under `--dry-run`. If the orchestrator is NOT on `main` (a detached/standalone `do`), skip — only the main checkout the marketplace tracks should advance. Step **C** runs this same recipe mid-drain at clean batch boundaries (nothing `live`/`corrupt`, `launched_pending` empty) so a merged fix compounds within the same drain; this post-drain run stays the unconditional final advance, covering the case where the last batch was non-empty or no clean boundary occurred.

### Report

When the loop exits (`done`), summarise the whole run: merged (keys) + worktrees torn down across all turns, launched (keys) — naming any **folded clusters** (lead `--covers` cover1,cover2) the §B2 group-fold pass collapsed, and the covers closed at merge — deferred (keys), and everything **parked for the human** — `parked` in-flight beads (expired/absent (non-blocking) lease, including any `held_guard` hot PR you withheld because its diff removed a safety property — name the property), plus `not_green` / conflicted draft PRs, plus any `held_main_red` PRs withheld because main's own CI was red this turn (name the filed `main-ci-red` P0 bead key). Tell the user how to follow along:

- Monitor live runs with `claude agents --json` (the plain `claude agents` needs a TTY).
- Review any **deferred** beads with `/flow triage` — it lists the whole deferred queue with each bead's open-question comment inline. `deferred` != done; to unstick one, `/flow triage <key> "<answer>"` posts the answer + reopens the bead (status → `open`), then re-run it interactively (WITHOUT `--auto`).

Expect defers, not all PRs: terse audit beads will sometimes score under 90% or raise questions. A high defer rate signals the audit evidence needs to be richer (a finding for the miners in §audit), not a consumer bug.

---

## propose

`/flow evolve propose`. Maintainer-gated (the Gate above ran). This is the generative half of Producer B. Where `audit` mines small, provably-safe fixes, `propose` goes after the judgment-side work a single run can never surface — net-new capability, real simplification, structural change — and files it as **ranked proposals for the maintainer**, not auto-drainable work. Read-then-file; it does not implement.

Everything here is scored against the repo-root `VISION.md`, the scoring anchor: serves the thesis / on the right side of the auto-vs-propose line / does not erode the floor. A candidate that cannot be anchored there is slop — drop it.

### A. Lenses — fan out one agent per angle (read-only, parallel)

Spawn parallel read-only agents (`subagent_type: Explore` via the `Agent` tool — read-only scope enforces the read-only contract, no Edit/Write, no recursive spawn — or a `Workflow` fan-out when available), one per angle. Each reads flow's code + `VISION.md` and proposes candidates FROM ITS ANGLE ONLY, each with: concrete evidence (`file:line` or a named gap), a one-line rationale tied to the vision, a `BLAST RADIUS:` line, and an honest confidence (0-1). The angles:

- **feature / capability gaps** — what should flow DO that it doesn't, judged against the vision and the unfinished tracks (e.g. MCP-first Jira, attachment download into the ticket stage)? A gap is a candidate only if you can name the concrete workflow flow cannot serve today.
- **simplification / over-engineering** — an abstraction not earning its keep, speculative generality with one caller, N things that could be one. Cite the call sites.
- **reorg / navigability** — structure and altitude: a doc or module layout that makes the system harder to hold than it needs to be.
- **dead weight / deletion** — code or docs that are unused and removable. PROVE zero refs (a proven deletion is provably-safe — see C).
- **architecture coherence** — a property the prose asserts but the code does not enforce ("by convention, should be by construction"); a seam that works but is brittle.
- **symmetry / consistency** — X has a test, handler, or doc that its sibling Y lacks; the asymmetry is usually a latent gap or bug.

A quiet angle is success, not failure — do not manufacture candidates to fill a lens.

### B. Adversarially verify each candidate (parallel)

For each surviving candidate, spawn an independent skeptic prompted to REFUTE it: is the problem real, or an artifact of a narrow read? Does it serve the vision, or just add surface? Is it manufactured motion (the ouroboros failure mode the vision names)? Default to refuted when uncertain. Kill any candidate the skeptic refutes. This is the brake on a generative pass inventing work to justify itself.

### C. Synthesize, split by disposition, rank

Dedup across lenses (merge candidates about the same root issue). Then split each survivor by the auto-vs-propose line:

- **Provably-safe → `audit`** (auto-drainable). A mechanical, behavior-preserving change with hard evidence — a proven-dead-code deletion, a zero-behavior-change simplification. File it exactly as §audit step 3 (labels `evolve`); it joins the normal drain. Such a disposition is also a natural `tier:trivial` (§audit step 2): stamp it `--labels "evolve,tier:trivial"` when it qualifies, so drain runs it at the cheaper worker model.
- **Judgment → `proposal`** (the maintainer's backlog). A feature, a real refactor, a reorg, an architecture challenge — anything whose merit is taste and fit, not a broke/works signal. File it as a plain `proposal` bead (label `proposal` only, NOT `evolve,proposal`). A plain `proposal` bead carries no `evolve` label, so drain never sees it — it lands in the maintainer's backlog and is run via `/flow <key>`, where the spec plan gate is the accept.

Rank by vision-alignment × value × evidence-strength × reviewability. Each `proposal` description MUST carry, beyond the evidence and blast-radius: your **confidence** and a **recommended default** (build / shelve / needs-discussion), so triaging it costs the maintainer seconds, not hours. Assign the same stable `<primary-relfile>::<short-symptom>` id and file through the §audit step 3 seam (the `--dedup-key` converges re-runs). Flag `hot` per §audit step 2 when it touches a hot or guard file.

### D. Report

Present the ranked proposal set: each proposal's title, disposition (`audit` auto-drains / `proposal` you run via `/flow <key>`), confidence, recommended default, and one-line rationale. Be honest when a pass found little — surfacing two real proposals and refuting the rest is success, not failure. The maintainer finds the `proposal` beads (`bd ready --label proposal`) and runs each via `/flow <key>`; the `audit` ones drain with §drain.

## epic

`/flow evolve epic`. Maintainer-gated (the Gate above ran). The **high-altitude producer**. Where `audit` mines defect-grain fixes and `propose` mines single-PR judgment work, `epic` goes after work no single PR can hold: net-new capability tracks, architecture-era shifts, cross-cutting initiatives, vision-tracks-not-yet-built — the kind of finding that becomes a parent epic with a tree of children. Read-then-file (with an optional bounded spike, §B); it does not implement and it does not auto-ship. Everything is scored against repo-root `VISION.md`.

This producer is **audacious by mandate** and runs **weekly, not nightly** — at theme altitude a daily cadence has weak signal (see `references/loop-engineering.md`). Its brake is a **conviction gate, not an evidence gate**: it does NOT require a proven track record or weeks of telemetry. Sometimes a change is clearly better and this producer exists to propose it. What it refuses is change for the sake of change — the ouroboros the vision names. The line between the two is *grounding* (§B), not caution.

### A. Lenses — fan out one read-only agent per angle (parallel, web-reaching)

Spawn parallel read-only agents (`subagent_type: Explore` via the `Agent` tool — read-only scope enforces the read-only contract, no Edit/Write, no recursive spawn), one per angle. Each reads flow's code + `MODULE.md` / `inventory.md` (the map) + `VISION.md` + the loop's own history (the friction log via `flow_friction.py` aggregates, `recall --metric` trends, `knowledge.jsonl` `MACHINERY:` entries, open epics via `bd list --type epic --json`) — it **compounds** on what the loop has lived rather than re-deriving from a cold stare. Each candidate carries: concrete grounding (a `file:line`, a named gap, a web citation, or a spike result), a one-line rationale tied to the vision, a `BLAST RADIUS:` line, a rough decomposition (the child tickets it would split into), and an honest confidence (0-1). The angles:

- **field-scan (the web angle)** — `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` the latest in agentic coding, loop engineering, Claude Code, LLM-harness design. Map each real advancement against what flow does today; propose epics that bring the good ones in. This is the audacious angle: the field moves weekly, and an advancement flow lacks is a real gap even with zero internal telemetry. Cite the source.
- **capability-track gaps vs vision** — a whole workflow the vision implies flow should serve but no track builds yet. A candidate only if you can name the concrete workflow flow cannot serve end-to-end today.
- **architecture-era shifts** — a structural premise that has aged at *system* scale: a layering that fights the grain now, an assumption (single-tracker, one-PR-per-ticket) a new reality outgrew. `propose` owns the single-seam version; `epic` owns the system-wide one.
- **the meta-loop** — flow's OWN self-evolution loop judged against loop-engineering canon (`references/loop-engineering.md`): is maker separated from checker everywhere, is memory compounding or re-derived, is there a real separate-verifier stop. A gap here is the highest-leverage epic class — it improves the engine that produces every other improvement.
- **unfinished tracks** — existing parent epics (e.g. flow-aut, flow-uo7) with stalled or never-built children: what closes the track? Lowest-ouroboros angle (the track was already judged worth starting), so weight it highest.

A quiet angle is success — do NOT manufacture an epic to fill a lens. The ouroboros risk peaks at this altitude; an empty pass beats a padded one.

### B. Ground each candidate — the conviction gate (adversarial, parallel)

For each surviving candidate, spawn an independent skeptic. Unlike `propose`'s default-refute brake, the epic skeptic's default is **engage if grounded and clearly-better; refute only the groundless or frivolous**. A candidate SURVIVES if it carries at least one *externalized* grounding — not raw assertion:

- a **web advancement** the field actually moved to (cited), OR
- a **witnessed signal** — a friction aggregate, a metric trend, an unfinished-track gap, OR
- a **spike result** (below).

Engineering judgment is how the skeptic *weighs* these — it is not itself a fourth grounding. "It's clearly better" with no cite, no witness, no spike is the pure-vibes hole and the ouroboros in disguise; refute it. But the grounding bar is **cheap and fast** (a citation, a ten-minute experiment), explicitly NOT the weeks-of-data bar `audit` / `propose` lean on. The skeptic asks, per candidate: (a) grounded at all? (b) serves the thesis, or builds an empire that adds surface? (c) manufactured motion to justify the loop's own existence? (d) **decomposable into do-loop-sized children** (§C — an epic that cannot be cut is escalated as a question, not filed)? Refute on a miss of (a)/(d) or a yes on (b)/(c).

**The spike (optional, bounded).** When a quick experiment would settle a candidate's worth better than more reading, the producer may run ONE throwaway spike: prototype the idea in a scratch worktree (or `$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR/tmp`), observe, discard it. Hard bounds — it **never touches `main` or the maintainer checkout**, it is time-boxed (a single spike ≤ ~15 min, at most a couple per run), and its only output is conviction captured into the epic's evidence. A spike substitutes for historical data: it lets the producer KNOW a change is better by trying it, not by waiting weeks to measure it. Spikes are optional; most candidates ground on a web cite or a witness without one.

The real stop condition is the **maintainer-accept gate** — a *separate* verifier, never self-graded. This producer ranks and hands off; it never ships.

### C. Decompose + file — the gearing (parallel)

The consumer (`drain`) is per-ticket → one PR; an epic is not one PR. The gearing is a **parent epic bead + a tree of do-loop-sized child beads**, reusing existing seams — no new code:

- **The parent is gated for free.** `evolve_select.py` filters `issue_type != "epic"` unconditionally (even `--include-proposals` cannot launch an epic-typed bead), so filing the parent `--type epic` means `drain` STRUCTURALLY never launches the whole epic as one run. Preserve that filter — it is load-bearing here, not decoration.
- **File the parent** through the §audit step 3 seam (`flow_beads_create.py`), `--type epic`, label `epic`, with a **dedup-key of the form `epic:<capability-track>`** (e.g. `epic:tracker-agnostic-frontdoor`). The `<relfile>::<symptom>` scheme breaks for cross-cutting epics; a stable capability-track slug is what makes a re-run *converge* instead of re-pitching the same empire, and — because the dedup fingerprint is checked across all statuses incl. closed — what keeps a *shelved* epic dead. Choose the slug from the capability, not the wording.
- **Children are plain `proposal` beads** (label `proposal` only, NOT `evolve`), filed `--type task --parent <epic-key>` through the same seam. Auto-shipping fragments of an UNACCEPTED epic is the ouroboros in its purest form; so children land in the maintainer's lane and run via `/flow <key>` at the spec-plan accept gate — the existing auto-vs-propose split, just rooted under an epic parent.
- **Lazy by default.** File ONLY the parent epic; carry the decomposition as an ordered PREVIEW in its description (each child: title + one-line rationale + rough blast radius). The preview is a CONTRACT that §E branches on: each child MUST be tagged net-new vs pre-existing-to-reparent — a NET-NEW child carries a `(NET-NEW ...)` marker plus its own `dedup epic:<track>::child-N-<symptom>` key, while a child mapping to an EXISTING bead carries the explicit tag `PRE-EXISTING CHILD to RE-PARENT (do NOT re-file): <key>` naming that bead's key. A bare bead key merely mentioned in a rationale does NOT count as a reparent target — only the explicit tagged-and-keyed form does. Materialize children only when the maintainer accepts the epic and runs the expand step (§E). This keeps the backlog clean of children belonging to epics that get shelved.

Rank survivors by **vision-leverage × ambition × decomposability × reviewability**. Vision-leverage dominates: an epic that closes an already-blessed unfinished track outranks a net-new empire (less ouroboros risk). Decomposability is FIRST a gate (§B.d), then a tie-breaker.

### D. Report

Present the ranked epic set. Each entry: title + capability-track slug, disposition (`epic` container; children run via `/flow <key>` after expand), the **decomposition preview** (the child tree, made visible before anything is built), confidence (0-1), a **recommended default** (build-now / shelve / needs-discussion), a one-line vision-leverage rationale, and the **grounding it cites** (which web advancement / witness / spike). The grounding is mandatory in the report — a maintainer must see at a glance this is not manufactured motion. Be honest when a pass found little: one real, well-grounded epic beats five padded ones. The maintainer finds filed epics with `bd list --type epic --json`, accepts one, and expands it (§E).

### E. Expand an accepted epic (maintainer-run)

When the maintainer accepts a lazily-filed epic, materialize its children: read the decomposition preview from the epic's description and process each child by its §C marker:
- **net-new child** (preview `(NET-NEW ...)`) → file fresh via `flow_beads_create.py --type task --parent <epic> --labels proposal --dedup-key "epic:<track>::child-<n>-<symptom>"`.
- **pre-existing child** (preview `PRE-EXISTING CHILD to RE-PARENT (do NOT re-file): <key>`) → reparent in place with a bare `bd update <key> --parent <epic>`. NEVER re-file it, and do NOT relabel it — the existing bead keeps its own identity, status, and labels.

The distinction matters because the `epic:<track>::child-N-<symptom>` dedup namespace is disjoint from a pre-existing bead's `<relfile>::<symptom>` key, so a naive re-file does NOT dedup-collide and WOULD mint a duplicate. Each child is then a normal ticket run via `/flow <key>` — do-loop-sized, gated at its own spec-plan accept. Children are deliberately NOT epic-aware; the altitude lives in the parent, the work lives in the leaves.

---

## curate (maintainer one-shot)

A **manual maintainer recipe**, NOT a routed `/flow evolve` sub-verb: a one-shot backlog cleanup that retro-curates stale `DECISION`/`FACT` entries in `.flow/<namespace>/knowledge.jsonl`. It is **propose-only** — the engine never auto-decides supersession; a human (or an agent under maintainer supervision) confirms every entry before anything is written. The standing producer for future rot is the reflect-stage supersession (flow-ufvu.2); this recipe is for draining the pre-existing backlog once.

The flow is three steps:

1. **Propose (read-only).** Emit a worklist of curatable, non-superseded entries:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sweep_knowledge.py propose [--type DECISION,FACT] > worklist.json
```

Each worklist item is `{id, ticket, ts, type, body}`, in file order. `--type` is a comma-separated filter (default `DECISION,FACT`); already-superseded entries are excluded. This step touches nothing.

2. **Author a manifest (the judgment step).** Cross-check each worklist entry against the current code + merged PRs. PROPOSE-ONLY is binding: **only entries you have confirmed as superseded go in the manifest** — an entry whose claim still holds is left alone. The manifest is a JSON array or JSONL of records, each `{superseded_id, superseding_ticket, rationale}` with an optional `branch` (absent → derived `feat/<superseding_ticket>`). The `rationale` becomes the tombstone record's body; it should say why the entry is moot and what replaced it.

3. **Apply (write).** Apply each confirmed supersession:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sweep_knowledge.py apply --manifest worklist-confirmed.json
```

Each record is applied through the `memory_append --supersedes` seam: an append-only tombstone `DECISION` entry whose `supersedes` points at the dead id (the target is never rewritten or removed). It is **idempotent** — a record whose target is already superseded is reported `skipped` and re-running the same manifest appends nothing. It **refuses an unknown id**: that record is reported `error`, the rest of the batch still processes, and the command exits non-zero if any record errored. The output is a per-record results summary (`applied` / `skipped` / `error`).

### Consolidation (density, not just staleness)

`propose`/`apply` retire entries that are individually WRONG. A separate problem is entries that are individually still true but REDUNDANT — near-duplicate notes about the same narrow mechanism, written weeks apart. `cluster`/`apply-cluster` collapse a confirmed near-duplicate group to ONE canonical entry, the same three-step shape as above:

1. **Cluster (read-only).** Group live, same-type, indexed entries by cosine similarity over the `memory_embed` sidecar:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sweep_knowledge.py cluster [--type DECISION,FACT] [--threshold 0.90] > clusters.json
```

Clustering is WITHIN-type only (never mixes a DECISION with a FACT) and complete-linkage: a candidate joins a group only if its cosine is above the threshold against EVERY current member, not just the seed, so an A~B, B~C, A!~C chain never lands in one group. An entry with no vector in the sidecar index (never embedded, or semantic indexing off) is excluded — it can neither seed nor join a group. A missing or empty sidecar yields `[]`. Each emitted group is `{cluster_id, type, min_cosine, members: [{id, ticket, ts, type, body}]}`; only groups of size >= 2 are emitted. The default threshold (0.90) was calibrated against this repo's own corpus — conservative on purpose, so it surfaces genuinely redundant pairs without proposing junk a maintainer would reject; re-tune per-corpus if the default over- or under-merges.

2. **Synthesize a manifest (the judgment step).** For each cluster you confirm is truly redundant, read every member's `body` and author ONE canonical body that preserves the union of what they say (a later member is often a refinement of an earlier one — keep the refinement, fold in anything the earlier member said that the later one dropped). A cluster you do NOT confirm is left alone; nothing in `cluster`'s output is auto-applied. The manifest is a JSON array or JSONL of records, each `{canonical_body, canonical_ticket, member_ids}` (`member_ids` from the confirmed cluster's `members[].id`), with optional `type` (default `DECISION`) and `branch` (absent → derived `feat/<canonical_ticket>`).

3. **Apply (write).** Collapse each confirmed cluster to one canonical entry:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sweep_knowledge.py apply-cluster --manifest clusters-confirmed.json
```

Each record is applied through the `memory_append --supersedes` seam with a LIST-valued `supersedes` (one canonical entry pointing at every member id at once — the mechanism that actually reduces corpus density; N single-target tombstones would collide on the same canonical body/id instead). Same discipline as `apply`: idempotent (a record whose members are ALL already dead is `skipped`), refuses an unknown member id (`error`, batch continues, non-zero exit). The output is a per-record results summary (`applied` / `skipped` / `error`), each `applied` record naming the new canonical id and the member count merged.
